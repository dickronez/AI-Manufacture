# AI-Manufacture

Value from big data becomes real when your data-intensive AI, machine learning and analytics applications go into production. That can be challenging, but this non-technical but practical guide helps by showing you what has made others successful.

Approaches such as Kubernetes for containerization, an effective data platform, streaming microservices and multi-tenancy can help you deploy across multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, and IoT edge computing.

Whether you already have data-driven applications in production, are about to deploy, or are just getting started, this might help.
